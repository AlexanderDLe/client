Current Build: http://xanofficial.com/

### Build Tools:

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript

- React
- Reactstrap (Library for bootstrap integration within React)

### Features:

- Fully responsive interface
- Slide-in navigation
- Fast due to being a React SPA
- Project gallery with links to site and github.
- Services pages outlining available offerings

### Development Notes:

- I am a huge fan of using SASS/SCSS - however, I encountered an issue when trying to combine it with my use of React. There is an official work-around utlizing SASS-Chokidar, however, it did not work for me thus I chose to use plain CSS in my React projects.
