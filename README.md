### Development Notes:

- Originally a contact page was created containing a contact form. This required a back-end that required a backend that utilized tools
  such as Node, Express, MongoDB, Nodemailer, etc. However, uploading an application that utilizes a back end system such as this on a
  platform such as Heroku requires a monthly fee. The Artist chose instead to forego the contact form and instead host the now backend-less
  website on Github Pages for free.
